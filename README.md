# lexnum

lexnum provides a lexicographic encoding of numbers.  It is based off of the
ideas presented in [Peter Seymour's Efficient Lexicographic Encoding of
Numbers](elen.pdf).  The paper's original source can be found at
[http://www.zanopha.com/docs/elen.pdf](http://www.zanopha.com/docs/elen.pdf),
but it is re-hosted [here](elen.pdf) for posterity.
